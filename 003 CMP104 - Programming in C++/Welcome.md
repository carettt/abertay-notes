Topics: [[Education]], [[C++]]  

## Welcome

General introduction to the module, how the module is run, and a brief introduction to C++ syntax.

---

### Introduction
- Lecturers
	- Dr. Suzy Prior
		- s.prior@abertay.ac.uk
	- Dr. Natalie Coull
		- n.coull@abertay.ac.uk
- 1 hour on-campus for coding help from lecturers
- Ask all coding questions on Teams
- Ask all administrative question through email (as seen above)

---

### Expectations
- Preventing Problems
	- Watch all the lecture content
	- MyLearningSpace has all the course content and information
	- Take responsibility for learning
	- An email will be received at the start of each week with all the activities and learning outcomes for the week
- If problems arise:
	- Ask the lecturers
	- Email the lecturers

> [!ATTENTION]
>Include the module code in all emails, as lecturers teach multiple modules across multiple years

> [!CITE]- Professional Environment
> Consider how you structure your emails, when asked to provide job references, we are often asked to comment on this
> \- Dr. Prior

### Operational Details
- CMP104 runs only in semester 1
- It is assesed purely on coursework
- Weekly materials
	- Available on Sunday 12pm
- On Campus Sessions
	- Groups with lab tutors and lecturers
	- First 2 hours are mandatory, attendance will be taken
		- Help with understanding of the concepts
	- Final hour is optional
		- This hour is for lecturers to provide help with coding issues

---

### Programming
- Practice
	- MyLearningSpace
		- Everything is electronic and available on MyLearningSpace
	- Books and Websites
		- Wait until after a few weeks to make any purchases, as often these will be confusing to a newcomer
- Definition of Programming
	- Programming is creating a program to control the behaviours of a machine following an algorithm
- Why C++
	- C++ is a very powerful progrmaming language
	- Allows you to manage memory and control resources in a way that other programming languages will struggle to
	- Basis for understanding how code is structured, this is necessary in order to be able to hack it

> [!INFO]-
> C++ is exceptionally powerful and isn't designed to teach you about programming. This means that it will not protect you.

### How to approach the module
- The module is about *programming concepts*
	- Generic concepts that apply to **all** languages
	- Object-Oriented Programming will be taught
- Problem based approach
	- Not all details are given
	- You *are* given an overview and other sources of information
		- in order to teach you how to undestand and solve problems
	- Specifically designed problems to help understand the concept of constructs covered

---

### VS2019
- Powerful IDE
- Has more features than needed (features to be abused? yes.)

---

### C++ Syntax

```cpp
// This is a C++ comment

#include <iostream> // include a header file (like libraries?)

using namespace std; // removes the need to prepend std namespace before cout and cin

int main() { // main block of code, ran by default
	double pounds, kilos; // variable declarations


	// Input with prompt
	cout << "Enter weight in pounds: "; // print to screen
	cin >> pounds; // data input
	cout << end1;

	// Output
	cout << pounds << "lbs. is (approx.) ";
	cout << kilos << "kgs.";
	cout << end1;
	cout << end1;

	return 0; // default return value is 0, so redundant return? 0 = successful execution
}
```

> [!TIP]- Dont worry!
> You are not required to understand all of it right now! But it would help to understand some of it.

### On Campus Session
- Demo on how to use VS2019
- Lab is *not* expected to be done during lab time (challenge? yes.)
	- Independent study is expected

---

### Assignments
- 3 units of assesments combined to pass the modules:
	- Unit 1
		- Quizzes in weeks 3-8
		- Week 1 has practice quizzes
	- Unit 2
		- Submissions of programming from weekly lab exercises
		- Weeks 3, 6, 8
	- Unit 3
		- Programming assignment and report
		- Brings together all the concepts from the modules
		- Deadline is set by ***university*** ask SEZ for extension if needed
- All have deadlines that are enforced
