## Identifiers

Introduction to identifiers, specifically for variables

---

### Identifiers
- How C++ knows what variable you want to use
- Can be used for other things such as:
	- classes
	- enums
- C++ is case-sensitive
- use camelCase for variables
- use PascalCase for classes

---

### Naming Conventions
- Mnemonic Notation
	- Mnemonic
		- assisting memory
		- each identifier is self descriptive
- Hungarian Notation
	- The first one or two letters should identify type
- you ***cannot*** use C++ keywords in your identifiers

>[!WARNING]
>Both naming conventions still require you to use camelCase for everything except classes (PascalCase)
