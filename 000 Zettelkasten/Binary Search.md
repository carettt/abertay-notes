### Summary

Binary search is an algorithm with a [[Big O Notation|time complexity]] of $O(log(n))$ for worst-case and average-case scenarios, and $O(1)$ best-case (when the target is n/2).

### How

Binary search works by dividing the inputs into two and checking if the target is higher or lower, then it splits the half which does have the target.
