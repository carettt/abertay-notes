___

### What is CHAOS all about
- How does a computer work
- what parts are inside it
- how do they rlate
- what do they do
- how do they do it
- how is it controlled
- what is coputing
- what does it mean to compute

___

### Why

- To unerstand the possibilites
	- Digital forensics
		- To know what the machine can possibly have been made to do.
		- Poking in the dark corners of the OS
		- To understand the opportunities for exploitation
	- Understand computer specifications

### A brief history of computing
- The five ages:
	- mechanical
	- So when was the first computer built?
	- 150-100 BC - The Antikythera Mechanism
		- Brass mechanism found in the early 1800s
		- Came from a Roman shipwreck
		- \[Insert Picture here\]
	- The Difference Engine - Victorian Era 1822
		- Charles Babbage
		- Originally designed for sin and logarithm tables
	- The Analytical Engine
		- Charles Babbage
		- Many different calculations that took instructions
		- Not built in his time, design never finished
		- Programmable
			- punched cards
			- Sequential control
		- Myth
			- Ada Lovelace
				- First programmer
				- Wrote the first programs for the analytical engine
		- Would have been Turing Complete
	- valve
		- Electricite
			- states switches binary
		- Zeus
		- EDVAC
		- Baby
		- EDSAC
		- ENIAC
		- Colossus
		- Alan Turing
			- Enigma and the Bletchley Park codebreakers
				- Built Colossus
				- 128 bytes of memory
			- The limits of Computability
			- Turing Machine
	- transistor
		- Smaller
		- Faster
		- Cheaper
	- integrated circuit/VLSI
		- The silicon chip
			- late 60s early 70s
		- smaller
		- faster
		- cheaper
		- Moore's Law
			- increased density of ocmponents on chip
			- Gordon Moore
				- co founder of intel
			- no of transitors on a chip will double every year
			- since 70s development has slowed a little
				- number of transistors doubles every 18 months
			- cost of a chip has remained almost unchanged
			- higher pakcing density means shorter electrical paths, giving higher performance
			- smaller size
			- reduced power and cooling requirements
			- \[Insert Image here\]
	- parallel/muticore/virtualization/cloud
		- Reaching the physical limit on the sizde of transistors
		- Moore's law is still holding true
			- based on processor speed
		- multiple processors working at the same time
	- Next generation?
		- disappearing computer?
			- everything has a processor
		- internet of things?

### Von Neumann architecture

- The "Stored Program" or Von Neumann architecture
	- John Von Neumann
- Control from inside the machine
- CPU
	- ALU
	- CC
- Main memory
- I/O - peripherals
- \[Insert Picture\]
