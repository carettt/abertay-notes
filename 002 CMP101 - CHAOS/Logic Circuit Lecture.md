## Logic Circuit Lecture

How do we make memory, how do we make the central control unit, how do we communicate between, in relation to the [[Von Neumann Architecture]]

- Half adder
	- two inputs
		- two numbers to sum
	- two outputs
		- sum
		- carry out
- Full adder
	- 1-bit addition
	- allows for a carry-in
	- three inputs
		- two numbers to sum
		- carry-in
	- two outputs
		- sum
		- carry out
- 4-bit addition circuit
	- 4 full adders
	- the circuit diagram displays the binary numbers backwards (i.e. LSB -> MSB)
